# Middleman::S3Sync

This gem determines which files need to be added, updated and optionally deleted
and only transfer these files up. This reduces the impact of an update
on a web site hosted on S3.

## Why not Middleman Sync?

[Middleman Sync](https://github.com/karlfreeman/middleman-sync) does a
great job to push [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com)  generated
websites to S3. The only issue I have with it is that it pushes
every files under build to S3 and doesn't seem to properly delete files
that are no longer needed.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'middleman-s3_sync'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install middleman-s3_sync

## Usage

You need to add the following code to your ```config.rb``` file:

```ruby
activate :s3_sync do |s3_sync|
  s3_sync.bucket                = ENV['S3_BUCKET'] # The name of the S3 bucket you are targetting. This is globally unique.
  s3_sync.region                = ENV['S3_REGION'] # The AWS region for your bucket.
  s3_sync.aws_access_key_id     = ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY']
  s3_sync.aws_secret_access_key = ENV['AWS_SECRET_KEY']
  s3_sync.exclude               = [/\.gz\z/i] # File pattern to exclude from upload
  s3_sync.prefer_gzip           = true # Look for *.gz files to upload in place of un-gzipped files
  s3_sync.delete                = true # We delete stray files by default.
  s3_sync.after_build           = true # We chain after the build step by default. This may not be your desired behavior...
end

set_default_headers cache_control: {max_age: 31449600, public: true}
set_headers 'text/html', cache_control: {max_age: 7200, must_revalidate: true}, content_encoding: 'gzip'
set_headers 'text/css', cache_control: {max_age: 31449600, public: true}, content_encoding: 'gzip'
set_headers 'application/javascript', cache_control: {max_age: 31449600, public: true}, content_encoding: 'gzip'
```

You can then start synchronizing files with S3 through ```middleman s3_sync```.

## Push All Content to S3

There are situations where you might need to push the files to S3. In
such case, you can pass the ```--force``` option:

    $ middleman s3_sync --force

## HTTP Caching

By default, ```middleman-s3_sync``` does not set caching headers. In
general, the default settings are sufficient. However, there are
situations where you might want to set a different HTTP caching policy.
This may be very helpful if you are using the ```asset_hash```
extension.

### Setting a policy based on the mime-type of a file

You can set a caching policy for every files that match a certain
mime-type. For example, setting max-age to 0 and kindly asking the
browser to revalidate the content for HTML files would take the
following form:

```ruby
caching_policy 'text/html', max_age: 0, must_revalidate: true
```

As a result, the following ```Cache-Control``` header would be set to ```max-age:0, must-revalidate```

### Setting a Default Policy

You can set the default policy by passing an options hash to ```default_caching_policy``` in your ```config.rb``` file:

```ruby
default_caching_policy max_age:(60 * 60 * 24 * 365)
```

This will apply the policy to any file that do not have a mime-type
specific policy.

### Caching Policies

The [Caching Tutorial](http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/) is a great
introduction to HTTP caching. The caching policy code in this gem is
based on it.

The following keys can be set:

| Key                | Value   | Header             | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ---                | ----    | ------             | -----------                                                                                                                            |
| `max_age`          | seconds | `max-age`          | Specifies the maximum amount of time that a representation will be considered fresh. This value is relative to the time of the request |
| `s_maxage`         | seconds | `s-maxage`         | Only applies to shared (proxies) caches                                                                                                |
| `public`           | boolean | `public`           | Marks authenticated responses as cacheable.                                                                                            |
| `private`          | boolean | `private`          | Allows caches that are specific to one user to store the response. Shared caches (proxies) may not.                                    |
| `no_cache`         | boolean | `no-cache`         | Forces caches to submit the request to the origin server for validation before releasing a cached copy, every time.                    |
| `no_store`         | boolean | `no-store`         | Instructs caches not to keep a copy of the representation under any conditions.                                                        |
| `must_revalidate`  | boolean | `must-revalidate`  | Tells the caches that they must obey any freshness information you give them about a representation.                                   |
| `proxy_revalidate` | boolean | `proxy-revalidate` | Similar as `must-revalidate`, but only for proxies.                                                                                    |

### Setting `Expires` Header

You can pass the `expires` key to the `caching_policy` and
`default_caching_policy` methods if you insist on setting the expires
header on a results. You will need to pass it a Time object indicating
when the resourse is set to expire.

> Note that the `Cache-Control` header will take precedence over the
> `Expires` header if both are present.

### A Note About Browser Caching

Browser caching is well specified. It hasn't always been the case.
Still, even modern browsers have different behaviors if it suits it's
developers or their employers. Specs are meant to be ignored and so they
are (I'm looking at you Chrome!). Setting the `Cache-Control` or
`Expires` headers are not a guarrantie that the browsers and the proxies
that stand between them and your content will behave the way you want
them to. YMMV.

## A Debt of Gratitude

I used Middleman Sync as a template for building a Middleman extension.
The code is well structured and easy to understand and it was easy to
extend it to add my synchronization code. My gratitude goes to @karlfreeman
and is work on Middleman sync.

Many thanks to [Gnip](http://gnip.com) and [dojo4](http://dojo4.com) for
supporting and sponsoring work on middleman-s3_sync.
